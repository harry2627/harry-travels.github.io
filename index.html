	<h1>MY 2020 HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE FOR TRAVELLERS</h1>
	<img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2018/giftguide2.jpg">
	<p>Travelers can be a fickle group of people to buy gifts for. We’re constantly coming and going, we usually don’t carry a lot of stuff with us, and no two travelers are alike so finding the perfect gift for the traveler in your life can be tricky.</p>
	<p>While a plane ticket is never a bad idea (I’m a window seat in case anyone is thinking of getting me one), I’ve put together this ultimate holiday gift guide for travelers as there’s a lot of great travel gear out there these days that helps people travel cheaper and better</p>
	<p>Even me, the gear-adverse traveler, likes a lot of this stuff!</p>

		<h2>1.Packing Cubes</h2>

		<p>Packing cubes are an awesome tool to help you stay organized while you travel. Whether you’re a budget backpacker or traveling with half a dozen suitcases, packing cubes will keep you organized as you travel the world. They come in a variety of sizes, allowing you to store items big and small. If you know a traveler who needs a hand staying organized, this is the gift for them! (If you want something nicer and better quality, check out these ones!)</p>

		<h2>2.Travel Padlock</h2>
		<img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/blue_padlocks.jpg">
		<p>This simple item is one of the most important for the budget traveler. Since many hostels have lockers, backpackers need to have their own travel lock when they’re on the road. While you can usually rent them at hostels, those prices add up after a while. I never leave home without a lock because I know it will come in handy.</p>

		<h2>3.Ear Plugs</h2>

		<p>Anyone who has ever stayed in a hostel knows that a quality pair of earplugs is a necessity. From chronic snorers to late-night drinkers to copulating couples in creaking bunks, hostels are known for their less-than-quiet accommodation. Add some earplugs to your shopping list. Because the gift of a good sleep is priceless!</p>

		<h2>4.DryFox Quick Dry Travel Towel</h2>
		<img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/travelgear5.jpg">
		<p>Unless you’re only staying at hotels or using Airbnb, you’re going to need to bring a towel when you travel. Having a lightweight, quick-drying towel makes a huge difference when you’re on the road since regular towels are too bulky and heavy (and they take a long time to dry). Get a travel towel for your next trip so you can travel light. They’re a compact, quick-drying solution that every backpacker needs. (Use code “nomadicmatt” for 15% off your purchase!)</p>

		<h2>5.Travel Adapter</h2>
		<img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/universal_adapter.jpg">
		<p>Nothing is more tedious than arriving to a new destination only to realize you can’t charge your devices because the electrical outlets are different. That’s why you’ll need a travel adapter. They’re a simple accessory. There’s a million out there but this is one I use as it covers every region of the world and comes with USB ports too. It’s cheap, easy to use, and lightweight. Everything you need in an adapter.</p>
